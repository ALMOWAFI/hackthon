Two groups are isomorphic when they have the same algebraic structure - meaning there's a one-to-one mapping that preserves the operation.\n\nThe key insight here is to examine the order of elements in each group. In Z_4, the element 1 has order 4 (you need to add it to itself 4 times to get back to 0). But in Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, every non-identity element has order 2.\n\nThis structural difference means these groups cannot be isomorphic, despite having the same size. When working with abstract structures, always check the properties beyond just cardinality.\n\nTry creating the operation tables for both groups to visualize their different structures.\n"

This is a good observation!\n\nHowever, when we encounter indeterminate forms, it's a signal to use more advanced techniques, not to stop our analysis. This particular limit is foundational in calculus.\n\nThe limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 is actually 1. We can see this geometrically (comparing the sine function to its argument), through Taylor series expansion, or using L'H\u00f4pital's rule.\n\nA helpful visualization: if you draw a unit circle and compare the length of a small arc (x) with the height of its sine value, you'll notice they become nearly identical as x gets very small.\n\nTry exploring this limit using different methods to deepen your understanding of why it equals 1.\n"
